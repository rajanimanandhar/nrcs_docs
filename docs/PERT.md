# PERT Calculation

### PERT Formula:
 Expected Time = (O + 4M + P/ 6)

 WHERE,

 O = Optimistic Time

 M = Most likely time

 P = Pessimistic Time

So, here as we are working on aglie methodology the tasks can be done simultaneously.  Weekly,

Optimistic (O): 30 hours/ sprint

Most likely (M):  42 hours/ sprint

Pessimistic (P) : 49 hours/ sprint

Expected Time 

    = (30+ 4*42 + 49)\6
   
    = 41.16 hours / sprint

In total there are 7 sprints, so Expected time for whole project 

    = 41.16 * 5
                             
    = 205.8 hours 

Start of project : November 16, 2025

End of project : December 19 , 2025 (Expected)
which is around 29/ 30 working days in total.
